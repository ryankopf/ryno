# Ryno

The ryno gem helps create pages on your Rails site. This is a project designed to help create a simple CMS system for Rails, without all the clutter.

## Usage

The gem is used by adding this to your ApplicationController.rb

You need to add this to your routes.rb
```
  mount Ryno::Engine => "/ryno"
```


## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ryno'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install ryno
$ rails ryno:install:migrations
$ rails db:migrate SCOPE=ryno
```
The gem depends on image_processing, which depends on vips. We are using vips to
help upload images in the CMS.
```
sudo apt install libvips-tools
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
